In humans, prolonged administration of the << beta 2-adrenoceptor >> agonist [[ terbutaline ]] leads to a desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular responses, which can be blunted by concomitant administration of the antianaphylactic drug ketotifen.
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized design, nine healthy male volunteers received disodium cromoglycate (4 x 200 mg/day, p.o.) or placebo for 3 weeks with terbutaline (3 x 5 mg/day, p.o.) administered concomitantly during the last 2 weeks. beta 2-Adrenoceptor cardiovascular function was assessed by the increase in heart rate and reduction of diastolic blood pressure induced by an incremental intravenous infusion of the unselective << beta-adrenoceptor >> agonist [[ isoprenaline ]]; beta 1-adrenoceptor cardiovascular function was assessed by exercise-induced tachycardia.

<< Schisandrin B >> protects against menadione-induced hepatotoxicity by enhancing [[ DT-diaphorase ]] activity.
Pretreating mice with schisandrin B (Sch B), a dibenzocyclooctadiene derivative isolated from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis, at a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days protected against << menadione >>-induced hepatic oxidative damage in mice, as evidenced by decreases in plasma [[ alanine aminotransferase ]] activity (78%) and hepatic malondialdehyde level (70%), when compared with the menadione intoxicated control.

We have expressed VIAAT and the << plasmalemmal transporters >> for [[ glycine ]] and GABA in a neuroendocrine cell line and measured the quantal release of glycine and GABA using a novel double-sniffer patch-clamp technique.
We found that << glycine >> is released from vesicles when [[ VIAAT ]] is coexpressed with either the neuronal transporter GlyT2 or the glial transporter GlyT1.
However, GlyT2 was more effective than GlyT1, probably because GlyT2 is unable to operate in the reverse mode, which gives it an advantage in maintaining the high cytosolic << glycine >> concentration required for efficient vesicular loading by [[ VIAAT ]].
The vesicular inhibitory phenotype was gradually altered from glycinergic to GABAergic through mixed events when << GABA >> is introduced into the secretory cell and competes for uptake by [[ VIAAT ]].
Interestingly, the VIAAT ortholog from Caenorhabditis elegans (UNC-47), a species lacking glycine transmission, also supports << glycine >> exocytosis in the presence of [[ GlyT2 ]], and a point mutation of UNC-47 that abolishes GABA transmission in the worm confers glycine specificity.
Together, these results suggest that an increased cytosolic availability of << glycine >> in [[ VIAAT ]]-containing terminals was crucial for the emergence of glycinergic transmission in vertebrates.

<< PLZ >> is also a substrate for [[ MAO ]], and studies suggest that a metabolite formed by the action of this enzyme on PLZ may be responsible for the increase in GABA observed.
To determine whether a metabolite formed by the action of MAO on PLZ may be responsible for the elevation in brain ORN observed, animals were pretreated with vehicle or the << MAO >> inhibitor [[ tranylcypromine ]] (TCP) before vehicle or PLZ (15 mg/kg), and brains collected 3 h later.

Hydrophobic amino acids in the hinge region of the 5A apolipoprotein mimetic peptide are essential for promoting << cholesterol >> efflux by the [[ ABCA1 ]] transporter.
The bihelical << apolipoprotein mimetic peptide 5A >> effluxes [[ cholesterol ]] from cells and reduces inflammation and atherosclerosis in animal models.
Compared with active peptides containing F or W, peptides containing E in either of these two positions were more than 10-fold less effective in effluxing << cholesterol >> by the [[ ABCA1 ]] transporter.
These results provide a rationale for future design of therapeutic apolipoprotein mimetic peptides and provide new insights into the interaction of hydrophobic residues on apolipoproteins with phospholipids in the lipid microdomain created by the << ABCA1 >> transporter during the [[ cholesterol ]] efflux process.

These data indicate that mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonists such as pizotifen and methysergide, and mixed 5-HT and catecholamine antagonists such as mianserin and mirtazapine are more potent antagonists of mCPP-induced behavioural inhibition in rats than the more selective << 5-HT2A >>/5-HT2C antagonist [[ ritanserin ]].

The << alpha1-adrenoceptor >> antagonist [[ prazosin ]] or the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, [beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopenta-methylenepropionyl1, O-Me-Tyr2, Arg8] vasopressin partially but significantly reduced tacrine pressor effect and mostly abolished it when administered concomitantly.

The tacrine pressor response was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the i.c.v. administration of the non-selective << muscarinic receptor >> antagonist [[ atropine ]] (ID50 = 1.45 microg), the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (ID50 = 4.33 microg), the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist methoctramine (ID50 = 1.39 microg) and the muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (ID50 = 31.19 microg).

State-dependent << cocaine >> block of [[ sodium channel ]] isoforms, chimeras, and channels coexpressed with the beta1 subunit.

<< Cocaine >> block of [[ hH1 channels ]] was greater than block of mu1 channels at voltages between -120 mV and -90 mV, suggesting that greater steady-state inactivation of hH1 channels in this voltage range makes them more susceptible to cocaine block.
